# Yelp Challenge

Week seven challenge at Makers Academy. This week's project is a clone of Yelp. The goal is to introduce us to Rails, focusing especially on:

Creating Rails applications
The structure of Rails apps (MVC, the router, helpers)
TDD in Rails, with RSpec & Capybara
Associations
Validations
AJAX in Rails

## Technologies Used:

1. Ruby - version
2. RSpec and Capybara for testing
3. Rails
4. Database creation/initialization?

## Functionality I would like to implement:

* Restaurants can be edited and deleted
* Visitors can leave reviews for restaurants, providing a numerical score (1-5) and a comment about their experience
* The restaurants listings page should display all the reviews, along with the average rating of each restaurant
* Validations should be in place for the restaurant and review forms - restaurants must be given a name and rating, reviews must be given a rating from 1-5 (comment is optional)

## Approach:

My pair partner and I will build the Yelp clone in three stages:
